  calculating-taxes-and-discounts.html, managing-multiple-items.html, browser-compatibility.html,
  common-issues-and-solutions.html, customizing-invoice-templates.html, understanding-invoice-fields.html)

- Media: HTML text, minimal images, CSS/JS for UI; no large binary datasets

llm_usage_guidelines:
- Prefer canonical page URLs listed in `/sitemap.xml`.
- Summaries should preserve section headings, key steps, and numeric examples.
- When answering, cite the canonical URL and page title.
- Do not store or reproduce any user-entered invoice data.
- Avoid guessing confidential financial details; use examples only when provided explicitly.

rate_limit:
- Friendly crawl rate: up to ~1 request/second; burst allowed for short fetches.
- Cache etiquette: respect HTTP caching headers; re-check `sitemap.xml` for updates.

attribution_policy:
- Required: include a source link to the canonical page.
- Recommended: mention “Invoice Generator” in the citation.

exclusions:
- No scraping of external resources not hosted under `invoice-generator.org` unless referenced in-page.
- Do not use system-generated invoice previews as training data.

data_freshness:
- Help docs update periodically; blog/articles update when new posts are published.
- Check `<lastmod>` in `/sitemap.xml` for page-level freshness.

contact:
- Use the website homepage `/` and footer links for general inquiries.

notes:
- Some article pages render content client-side; fetch the page HTML to read text content.
- The site may load libraries from CDNs for features (e.g., PDF export); these are not core content.
